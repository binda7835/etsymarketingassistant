# Example environment variables for local builds
# Set VITE_PUBLIC_AI_URL to a tokenless public Hugging Face Space or other public inference endpoint.
# Example (replace USER and SPACE with the actual values):
# VITE_PUBLIC_AI_URL="https://hf.space/embed/USER/SPACE/+/api/predict" 
# or
# VITE_PUBLIC_AI_URL="https://huggingface.co/spaces/USER/SPACE/api/predict"

# Leave empty to skip public space and rely on proxy/Gemini fallback
